# Personal-Macros
## Bunch of Macros of my own.  All built on JS Macros

Im gonna drop macros in whole packs every so often

Them we'' make branch repo with all macros one by one for easy search

Good idea would be to group them by function, like 
- Remote Control 
- Universal
- Keybinded
- Playsound
- Chat actions

  EVENTS
- group by events


ALSO separate branch just fo sound effects to play in macros (Need to get proper YT to .wav converter) (Prefferably saving shit into cloud, or here}
