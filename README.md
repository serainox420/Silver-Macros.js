# Personal-Macros
## Bunch of Macros of my own.  All built on JS Macros

# As for now its all mixed, some do work nicely, some do not at all, others are only my libraries to hold some lines etc. its hell of a mess.

-WHOOSTHAT - Nice sound effect and chat message for incoming foes
-REMOTE TRIGGER - Macro that triggers runscript or Baritone using chat messages
-STOPPER - Classic keybind macro that terminates both Baritone and Alto [need to find a way not to drop it in chat in case of missing prexix]
-420 - drops SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY in IRC chat / NONNEASKED - Same but noone asked
-AUD, AUDIO, A1 etc - Its just me playing with some playsound.

Im gonna drop macros in whole packs every so often

Them we'' make branch repo with all macros one by one for easy search

Good idea would be to group them by function, like 
- Remote Control 
- Universal
- Keybinded
- Playsound
- Chat actions

  EVENTS
- group by events


ALSO separate branch just fo sound effects to play in macros (Need to get proper YT to .wav converter) (Prefferably saving shit into cloud, or here}
